This project is the practical implementation of ProGAN paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196)
Due to computational limitations, these are trained till 5 epochs instead of 20 epochs for every step mentioned in paper and has stopped in resolution 64. So the results are not exact when compared to the paper. But, have yielded a good results.
